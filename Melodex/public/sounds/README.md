# Sound Effects for Melodex

This directory contains audio files for the dramatic persona reveal feature.

## Files:

- `card-flip.mp3` - Sound effect for the card flip animation (optional)

## How to add sound effects:

1. Place your audio files in this directory
2. Reference them in the PersonaReveal component
3. The audio will play during the dramatic reveal sequence

## Note:

If you don't have audio files, the animation will still work perfectly without sound!
