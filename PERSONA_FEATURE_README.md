## 🧠 Assignment Algorithm

The persona assignment uses a weighted scoring system:

### Scoring Weights

- **Genre Matching (40%)**: Checks if user's genres match persona's preferred genres
- **Energy Matching (25%)**: Compares user's average energy with persona's energy profile
- **Valence Matching (25%)**: Compares user's average valence with persona's mood profile
- **Tempo Bonus (10%)**: Special bonuses for specific tempo ranges (e.g., Dragonstep for >140 BPM)

### Audio Feature Ranges

- **Energy**: 0.0 (low) to 1.0 (high)
- **Valence**: 0.0 (sad/negative) to 1.0 (happy/positive)
- **Tempo**: 0-200+ BPM

### Fallback Logic

- If no persona scores above 30 points, assigns "Genre Jumper" (🎭)
- Handles edge cases and diverse listening patterns

## 🚀 Usage

### Automatic Assignment

Personas are automatically assigned when users sync their Spotify data:

```javascript
// During profile sync
const persona = assignPersona(avgValence, avgEnergy, avgTempo, dominantGenres);
```

### Manual Assignment

Users can manually trigger persona assignment:

```javascript
// Frontend API call
const response = await apiService.assignPersona();
const persona = response.persona;
```

### Display

The persona is displayed in the MusicProfile component:

```jsx
{
  persona && (
    <div className="text-center">
      <div className="text-6xl">{persona.id}</div>
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold">{persona.name}</h3>
      <p className="italic">{persona.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Schema

```javascript
persona: {
  id: String,        // Emoji character
  name: String,      // Persona name
  description: String // Persona description
},
audioFeatures: {
  valence: Number,           // Average valence (0-1)
  energy: Number,           // Average energy (0-1)
  tempo: Number,            // Average tempo (BPM)
  dominantGenres: [String]  // Top 3 genres
}
```

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/profile/assign-persona` - Assign persona manually
- Enhanced `POST /api/profile/sync` - Auto-assigns persona during sync

### Spotify API Integration

- Fetches top 20 tracks for comprehensive analysis
- Retrieves audio features for each track
- Calculates averages for valence, energy, and tempo
- Determines dominant genres from top artists
